## Mock server for http testing

Run `yarn server` to run the server that allows CRUD behavior on `db.json` and the listed collections (only `tasks`).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
